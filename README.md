# Advent-of-Code-2021
 This is my "Advent of Code 2021" solution, dont expect all problems solved.

 Each Day has its own folder with its own main.py file.

 Each main.py file has (if i solved both problems) two solutions.

 Just run main_01() for the first part or main_02() for the second part to solve the problem.

 To get your input running just paste your raw input into "input.txt"

Ok, got to the point where i dont have a lot of time for this :(

Hopefully i will have more time in the future, looking forward to solving them in the
beginning of next year.
